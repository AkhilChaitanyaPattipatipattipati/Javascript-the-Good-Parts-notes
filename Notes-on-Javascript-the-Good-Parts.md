##Chapter 1

> Most programming languages contain good parts and bad parts. I discovered that I could be a better programmer by using only the good parts and avoiding the bad parts. After all, how can you build something good out of bad parts?

The best parts of Javascript include:
* functions
* loose typing (variables are declared as variables, without a type)
* dynamic objects

The worst parts include global variables (because "they are evil").
