Javascript the Good Parts by _Douglas Crockford_ calls out all the best parts of Javascript and lists the bad parts. It's about making sure you know the really important parts of the language and create good habits instead of having to break bad ones down the line.

The first pass of the book is quick but thank you Douglas for pointing out straight away that it was a book that had to be read several times for one to 'get it', that was certainly the case!

I wrote notes throughout. Notes I'll be refining as I revisit the book and take another look, notes I'll be making simpler as I understand more. So here they are, I hope they help.
